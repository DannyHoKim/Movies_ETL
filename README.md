# Movies ETL

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to use the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process on Movie data. The data was extracted from Wikipedia and Kaggle. The data was then tranformed, cleaing the data. Finally, the data was loaded into the SQL database. 

## Results

After the ETL process two new tables were created in PostgreSQL. Through Python both data sets were cleaned, merged together, and loaded onto the database. The function created in this challenge has allowed for an automated pipeline that is able to collect, clean, and load data from the different sources onto PostgreSQL.
